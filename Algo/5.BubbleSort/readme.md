Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This algorithm is comparison based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and 
worst case complexity are of O(n^2) where n is the number if items.
